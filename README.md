# Awesome AWS Workshops [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

(Unofficial) Curated list of awesome public workshops around different areas. As we have all of those scattered in different locations, the idea is to provide an easy access in a central repository, in a collaborative fashion using a repo. As the repositories listed here are discovered, we'll start including the number of :fontawesome-regular-star: each one received.

Inspired by [awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php).

!!! warning
    As you go through each workshop, they might create billable AWS resources. You should remove those at the end of the workshop to avoid incurring future charges to your account. Follow each workshop instrutions to do so.
