_AI and Machine Learning
related Workshops_

##### [AI Workshop](https://github.com/samir-souza/ai-workshop)

Artificial Intelligence Workshop

##### [AI/ML Workshops](https://github.com/drandrewkane/AI_ML_Workshops)

These are run as a series at AWS public events, such as Lofts, Summits or Builders' Days, but can all be run independently. They will walk you through several AI/ML offerings from AWS that you can use to build and train models or easily intergrate AI/ML features into your applications.
Below you'll find a list of events where these have been run, so please select the session that your are in so that you can see what's being run today. Our Evangelists and SA's will work with you in these labs to help you complete the sessions.

##### [Amazon Textract Code Samples](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-textract-code-samples)

This repository contains example code snippets showing how Amazon Textract and other AWS services can be used to get insights from documents.

##### [Amazon Textract Enhancer](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-textract-enhancer)

This workshop demonstrates how to build a text parser and feature extractor with Amazon Textract. With amazon Textract you can detect text from a PDF document or a scanned image of a printed document to extract lines of text, using Text Detection API. In addition, you can also use Document Analysis API to extract tables and forms from the scanned document.

##### [Analyze documents with Amazon Textract and generate output in multiple formats](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-textract-textractor)

textractor helps speed up PoCs by allowing you to quickly extract text, forms and tables from documents using Amazon Textract. It can generate output in different formats including raw JSON, JSON for each page in the document, text, text in reading order, key/values exported as CSV, tables exported as CSV. It can also generate insights or translate detected text by using Amazon Comprehend, Amazon Comprehend Medical and Amazon Translate. It takes advantage of Textract response parser library to easily consume JSON returned by Amazon Textract.

##### [AWS AI Services Workshop Series](https://ai-services.go-aws.com)

In this series of workshops, we’ll build applications to learn about AWS AI Services and how they’re used by millions of AWS customers to build applications that add value to their businesses.

##### [AWS DeepComposer labs](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepcomposer-samples)

AWS DeepComposer workshop.

##### [AWS DeepLens Workshop](https://github.com/mahendrabairagi/DeeplensWorkshop)

AWS DeepLens Workshop.

##### [AWS High Level AI Services Workshop](https://ai-services.labgui.de/)

Stop guessing, start reasoning: Adding ubiquitous intelligence to your applications (ASR + NLP chapter)

##### [AWS RoboMaker Workshop](https://robomakerworkshops.com/)

In this workshop you become familiar with AWS RoboMaker, a service that enables you to easily develop, simulate and deploy intelligent robot applications that integrate with AWS services. This includes AWS machine learning services, monitoring services, and analytics services that enable a robot to stream data, navigate, communicate, comprehend, and learn. Today, you will also get hands on with a physical robot (Robotis TurtleBot 3 Burger) to learn how to manage and deploy robot applications to production robots using AWS RoboMaker.

##### [Build, train, debug, deploy and monitor with SageMaker](https://github.com/aws-samples/reinvent2019-aim362-sagemaker-debugger-model-monitor)

Build, train & debug, and deploy & monitor with Amazon SageMaker.

##### [Getting started with Amazon SageMaker](https://www.getstartedonsagemaker.com/workshop/)

Amazon SageMaker Autopilot automatically trains and tunes the best machine learning models for classification or regression, based on your data while allowing to maintain full control and visibility. With SageMaker Autopilot, you provide a tabular dataset and select the target column to predict, which can be a number (such as a house price, called regression), or a category (such as spam/not spam, called classification). SageMaker Autopilot chooses the right algorithm, automatically tunes the hyperparameters of the chosen algorithm, and provides a leaderboard of recommended models with an automatically generated notebook that you can edit and reuse. You then can directly deploy the model to production with just one click, or iterate on the recommended solutions with Amazon SageMaker Studio to further improve the model quality. In this workshop, we will walk you through the steps needed to automatically build and train a machine learning model using Amazon SageMaker Autopilot.

##### [How to prevent misdiagnosis of breast diseases using Amazon SageMaker, Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth and AWS Step Functions:](https://github.com/aws-samples/mammography-classification-workshop)

Our challenge for this workshop is to prevent misclassification of images, that could cause the system to spend more money on retaking those exams or possibly leading to a misdiagnosis.

##### [Index your pile of papers with Amazon Textract, Amazon Comprehend and Amazon Elasticsearch Service](https://github.com/aws-samples/workshop-textract-comprehend-es/)

Amazon Textract overcomes these challenges by using machine learning, providing the ability to "read" virtually any type of document to extract text and data without the need of custom code. Once the information is captured, you can use other services like Amazon Comprehend to get insight on it (key phrases, people, dates, ...), Amazon Translate to translate it, Elasticsearch to index it for later search.

The workshop will demonstrate the usage of the following AWS services to achieve the process mentioned above.

##### [Lunar Lander on AWS: Land a Rocket with Reinforcement Learning](https://lunar-lander.workshop.aws/en)

The purpose of Lunar Lander is to land a rocket (and a successful video game) with reinforcement learning. In this workshop, you will use reinforcement learning (RL) to train a lunar lander vehicle in a Box2D simulation environment to land itself on the surface of the moon. The agent will be trained using Amazon SageMaker RL.

##### [Machine Learning Data Lake Workshop](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-ml-data-lake-workshop)
