# Alexa

_Alexa is Amazon’s cloud-based voice service available on hundreds of millions of devices from Amazon
and third-party device manufacturers. With Alexa, you can build natural voice experiences that
offer customers a more intuitive way to interact with the technology they use every day.
We offer a collection of tools, APIs, reference solutions, and documentation to make it easier
to build for Alexa._

When creating a smart building environment utilizing both Amazon Alexa and AWS IoT enables builders to create an end to end voice controlled building experience. Unlike traditional architectures Amazon Alexa and AWS IoT allow for cost optimized serverless workloads. This means that you don’t have to provision long running servers, instead your functions run only when users invoke Alexa with voice commands.
